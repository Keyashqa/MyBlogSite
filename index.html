                    <h3>Head hits with realization!!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Today, I had some quite impressive realizations. My close friend reminded me who I am. In layman terms, I love to take risks, was keeping no back-up plans, becuase I believe, keeping a back-up makes you less efficient to work towards your goals.
                        But, after my JEE, I have completely changed my fundamental identities, taking every step with a back-up. That's why, I was soo concerned to have a back-up career along with my Aim. Thinking that, I could focus on everything I want, which made my efficiency to almost zero at anything.
                         Even tough, I know That One cannot have everything he wants,BUT, still I was trying to do that.What a foolish & coward mind right?!. Anyways, thanks again for reminding, 'You cannot measure the depth, without wetting yourself.Take risk, It is not as hard as it seems to be.'
